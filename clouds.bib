abstract = {This paper presents a novel generalization of the optical flow equation to the case of refraction, and it describes a method for recovering the refractive structure of an object from a video sequence acquired as the background behind the refracting object moves. By structure here we mean a representation of how the object warps and attenuates (or amplifies) the light passing through it. We distinguish between the cases when the background motion is known and unknown. We show that when the motion is unknown, the refractive structure can only be estimated up to a six-parameter family of solutions without additional sources of information. Methods for solving for the refractive structure are described in both cases. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on real data, and results of applying the estimated refractive structure to the task of environment matting and compositing are presented.},

abstract = {Aerosols affect climate, health and aviation. Currently, their retrieval assumes a plane-parallel atmosphere and solely vertical radiative transfer. We propose a principle to estimate the aerosol distribution as it really is: a three dimensional (3D) volume. The principle is a type of tomography. The process involves wide angle integral imaging of the sky on a very large scale. The imaging can use an array of cameras in visible light. We formulate an image formation model based on 3D radiative transfer. Model inversion is done using optimization methods, exploiting a closed-form gradient which we derive for the model-fit cost function. The tomography model is distinct, as the radiation source is unidirectional and uncontrolled, while off-axis scattering dominates the images.},

abstract = {We present a method for handling nonscattering regions within diffusing domains. The method develops from an iterative radiosity-diffusion approach using Green's functions that was computationally slow. Here we present an improved implementation using a finite element method (FEM) that is direct. The fundamental idea is to introduce extra equations into the standard diffusion FEM to represent nondiffusive light propagation across a nonscattering region. By appropriate mesh node ordering the computational time is not much greater than for diffusion alone. We compare results from this method with those from a discrete ordinate transport code, and with Monte Carlo calculations. The agreement is very good, and, in addition, our scheme allows us to easily model time-dependent and frequency domain problems.},

abstract = {We wish to measure and separate the contribution of atmospheric turbulent layers for multiconjugate adaptive optics. To this end, we propose to create a periodic fringe pattern in the sodium layer and image it with a modified Hartmann sensor. Overlapping sections of the fringes are imaged by a lenslet array onto contiguous areas in a large-format camera. Low-layer turbulence causes an overall shift of the fringe pattern in each lenslet, and high-attitude turbulence results in internal deformations in the pattern. Parallel Fourier analysis permits separation of the atmospheric layers. Two mirrors, one conjugate to a ground layer and the other conjugate to a single high-altitude layer, are shown to widen the field of view significantly compared with existing methods.},

The system uses a CCD camera, wide-angle optics, and a laser. Imaging a vertical laser beam from the side allows high-altitude resolution in the boundary layer all the way to the ground. The dynamic range needed for the molecular signal is several orders of magnitude in the standard monostatic method, but only approximately 1 order of magnitude with the CLidar method. Other advantages of the Clidar method include low cost and simplicity. Observations at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, show excellent agreement with the modeled molecular-scattering signal. The scattering depends on angle (altitude) and the polarization plane of the laser.},

The altitudes are derived geometrically from the position of the camera and laser with submeter resolution near the ground. The system requires no overlap correction needed in monostatic lidar systems and needs a much smaller dynamic range. Nighttime measurements of both molecular and aerosol scattering were made at Mauna Loa Observatory. The CLidar aerosol total scatter compares very well with a nephelometer measuring at 10 m above the ground. The results build on earlier work that compared purely molecular scattered light to theory, and detail instrument improvements.},

@article{Busono1999,
abstract = {This paper shows that if the off-beam idle detectors in the detection ring of a fourth-generation x-ray computed tomography (CT) system are used to measure the scattered radiation, it is numerically feasible to reconstruct electron-density images to supplement the conventional attenuation-coefficient images of transmitted radiation. It is also shown that by combining these two images, composition changes can be detected with the aid of an effective-atomic-number indicator. The required image-reconstruction algorithms are developed and tested against Monte Carlo simulated measurements, for a variety of phantom configurations. In spite of the relatively poor statistical quality of scattering measurements, it is demonstrated that electron-density images of reasonable quality can be obtained. In addition, it is shown that composition discrimination is possible for materials of effective atomic number greater than five, in the photon energy range of a typical medical x-ray CT system operating at 102 kVp. The obtained supplementary electron-density and composition images can be useful in radiotherapy planning and for studying tumour histology, as well as in industrial and security applications where identification of materials based on density and composition is important.},

and backscattering coefficients $\backslash$[bb(555)$\backslash$] using three different
bio-opticalalgorithms. For mooring/shipboard comparisons, we observed
meanrelative errors of 70.5\%/-3.8\% (SeaWiFS OC4v4), -21.4\%/-49.3\%(SeaWiFS
Stumpf), 109.5\%/13.4\% (MODIS OC3m) and 0.5\%/-48.9\%(MODIS Stumpf)

we found mean relative errors of -69.4\% (-67.1\%), -52.6\% (-48.9\%),
and -62.7\% (-65.4\%) for the Arnone, GSM, and QAA algorithmsfor

and 16.5\% were found between SeaWiFS-derived (Arnone, GSM, and QAA
algorithms, respectively) and moored bb(555) measurements. Discrepancies
in Rrs at blue wavelengths are attributed to the satelliteatmospheric
correction and sea surface variations of the mooredradiometers. High
spatial and temporal variability of bio-optical propertiescoupled
with differences in measurement techniques (pixel versus point)contribute
to inconsistencies between remotely sensed and in situ biooptical
properties.},

abstract = {A sensor constellation capable of determining the location and detailed concentration distribution of chemical warfare agent simulant clouds has been developed and demonstrated on government test ranges. The constellation is based on the use of standoff passive multispectral infrared imaging sensors to make column density measurements through the chemical cloud from two or more locations around its periphery. A computed tomography inversion method is employed to produce a 3D concentration profile of the cloud from the 2D line density measurements. We discuss the theoretical basis of the approach and present results of recent field experiments where controlled releases of chemical warfare agent simulants were simultaneously viewed by three chemical imaging sensors. Systematic investigations of the algorithm using synthetic data indicate that for complex functions, 3D reconstruction errors are less than 20\% even in the case of a limited three-sensor measurement network. Field data results demonstrate the capability of the constellation to determine 3D concentration profiles that account for \~{}?86\%? of the total known mass of material released.},

abstract = {We report on the construction and calibration of a dual photoelastic-modulator (PEM)-based polarimetric camera operating at 660?nm. This camera is our first prototype for a multispectral system being developed for airborne and spaceborne remote sensing of atmospheric aerosols. The camera includes a dual-PEM assembly integrated into a three-element, low-polarization reflective telescope and provides both intensity and polarization imaging. A miniaturized focal-plane assembly consisting of spectral filters and patterned wire-grid polarizers provides wavelength and polarimetric selection. A custom push-broom detector array with specialized signal acquisition, readout, and processing electronics captures the radiometric and polarimetric information. Focal-plane polarizers at orientations of 0\{$\backslash$textdegree\} and \{$\backslash$textminus\}45\{$\backslash$textdegree\} yield the normalized Stokes parameters q=Q/I and u=U/I respectively, which are then coregistered to obtain degree of linear polarization (DOLP) and angle of linear polarization. Laboratory test data, calibration results, and outdoor imagery acquired with the camera are presented. The results show that, over a wide range of DOLP, our challenging objective of uncertainty within \{$\backslash$textpm\}0.005 has been achieved.},

abstract = {A dual-photoelastic-modulator- (PEM-) based spectropolarimetric camera
concept is presented as an approach for global aerosol monitoring
from space. The most challenging performance objective is to measure
degree of linear polarization (DOLP) with an uncertainty of less
than 0.5\% in multiple spectral bands, at moderately high spatial
resolution, over a wide field of view, and for the duration of a
multiyear mission. To achieve this, the tandem PEMs are operated
as an electro-optic circular retardance modulator within a high-performance
reflective imaging system. Operating the PEMs at slightly different
resonant frequencies generates a beat signal that modulates the polarized
component of the incident light at a much lower heterodyne frequency.
The Stokes parameter ratioq=Q/I is obtained from measurements acquired
from each pixel during a single frame, providing insensitivity to
pixel responsivity drift and minimizing polarization artifacts that
conventionally arise when this quantity is derived from differences
in the signals from separate detectors. Similarly,u=U/I is obtained
from a different pixel; q and u are then combined to form the DOLP.
A detailed accuracy and tolerance analysis for this polarimeter is
presented.},

abstract = {The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on the Terra satellite has demonstrated the capability to retrieve aerosol optical depths, surface bidirectional reflectance factors, and hemispherical reflectances over a wide variety of land surface types. In particular, its multiangular imaging design has enabled the application of algorithms that minimize sensitivity of the aerosol retrievals to the brightness of the underlying surface. The novel aerosol algorithm that was developed prior to launch has had notable quantitative success. Over certain scene types, however, the approach contained obvious spatial artifacts, so a postlaunch refinement to the algorithm was implemented. It constrains the retrieved aerosol models and optical depths such that the implied angular shape of the surface hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF) is similar among all of the MISR wavelengths. This upgrade has resulted in three tangible benefits: (1) the occurrence of outliers has been dramatically reduced, (2) correlations with AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) aerosol sunphotometer data are quantitatively improved, and (3) the quality of surface products is markedly enhanced. MISR Level 2 aerosol and surface products are archived at the NASA Langley Atmospheric Sciences Data Center. Those having version numbers v0012 and higher incorporate this upgrade in the data processing software.},

abstract = {A novel experimental procedure to measure the near-surface distribution of atmospheric trace gases by using passive multiaxis differential absorption optical spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is proposed. The procedure consists of pointing the receiving telescope of the spectrometer to nonreflecting surfaces or to bright targets placed at known distances from the measuring device, which are illuminated by sunlight. We show that the partial trace gas absorptions between the top of the atmosphere and the target can be easily removed from the measured total absorption. Thus it is possible to derive the average concentration of trace gases such as NO(2), HCHO, SO(2), H(2)O, Glyoxal, BrO, and others along the line of sight between the instrument and the target similar to the well-known long-path DOAS observations (but with much less expense). If tomographic arrangements are used, even two- or three-dimensional trace gas distributions can be retrieved. The basic assumptions of the proposed method are confirmed by test measurements taken across the city of Heidelberg.},

scattering, which is polluting any observation. Confocal imaging
reduces the influence of such global illumination effects by carefully
focusing illumination and viewing rays from a large aperture to a
specific location within the object volume. The selected light paths
still contain some global scattering contributions, though. Descattering
based on high frequency illumination serves the same purpose. It
removes the global component from observed light paths. We demonstrate
that confocal imaging and descattering are orthogonal and propose
a novel descattering protocol that analyzes the light transport in
a neighborhood of light transport paths. In combination with confocal
imaging, our descattering method achieves optical sectioning in translucent
media with higher contrast and better resolution.},

abstract = {A graphics processing unit-based parallel multigrid solver for a radiative transfer equation with vacuum boundary condition or reflection boundary condition is presented for heterogeneous media with complex geometry based on two-dimensional triangular meshes or three-dimensional tetrahedral meshes. The computational complexity of this parallel solver is linearly proportional to the degrees of freedom in both angular and spatial variables, while the full multigrid method is utilized to minimize the number of iterations. The overall gain of speed is roughly 30 to 300 fold with respect to our prior multigrid solver, which depends on the underlying regime and the parallelization. The numerical validations are presented with the MATLAB codes at https://sites.google.com/site/rtefastsolver/.},

Imaging is demonstrated through nearly 100 mean free paths of scattering phantom in a single-ended geometry. The resolution and imaging contrast are compared to those obtained with conventional OCT systems which chiefly detect singly scattered light.},

Amongst these are aerosols, that represent a strong, poorly-known modulator of the Earths climate. In this chapter the reader will first find an introduction to the lidar technique in terms of instrumental components. The lidar equation, describing the factors controlling the atmosphere- backscattered signal will then be addressed. Solution of the lidar equation to retrieve optical properties of atmospheric aerosol will be considered. Finally, a method to retrieve aerosol extinction, surface area and volume from single-wavelength lidar observations will be discussed. These arguments should suffice to deal with both the managing of simple lidar systems and with the comprehension of the large amount of information that forthcoming, space-based lidars will provide in the near future.},

abstract = {The second generation of ocean-color-analyzing instruments requires more accurate atmospheric correction than does the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), if one is to utilize fully their increased radiometric sensitivity. Unlike the CZCS, the new instruments possess bands in the near infrared (NIR) that are solely for aiding atmospheric correction. We show, using aerosol models, that certain assumptions regarding the spectral behavior of the aerosol reflectance employed in the standard CZCS correction algorithm are not valid over the spectral range encompassing both the visible and the NIR. Furthermore, we show that multiple-scattering effects on the algorithm depend significantly on the aerosol model. Following these observations, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the NIR bands for atmospheric correction to the required accuracy. Examples of the dependence of the error on the aerosol model, the turbidity of the atmosphere, and surface roughness (waves) are provided. The error in the retrieved phytoplankton-pigment concentration (the principal product of ocean-color sensors) induced by errors in the atmospheric correction are shown to be <20\% in approximately 90\% of the cases examined. Finally, the aerosol thickness ($\tau$($\alpha$)) is estimated through a simple extension of the correction algorithm. Simulations suggest that the error in the recovered value of $\tau$($\alpha$) should be ≲ 10\%.},

With an increasing number of applications, the number of different imaging modalities is also increasing. This review summarizes recent developments in tomographic methods for scattering and nonscattering samples. These two different cases of optical tomography are typically represented by biomedical imaging and atmospheric tomography, representing high- and low-scattering samples, respectively. An essential prerequisite for tomographic analyses is an understanding of light propagation in different media, which allows for the development of specific reconstruction algorithms for the different tomographic tasks.},

The dark channel prior is a kind of statistics of outdoor haze-free images. It is based on a key observation - most local patches in outdoor haze-free images contain some pixels whose intensity is very low in at least one color channel. Using this prior with the haze imaging model, we can directly estimate the thickness of the haze and recover a high quality haze-free image. Results on a variety of hazy images demonstrate the power of the proposed prior. Moreover, a high quality depth map can also be obtained as a by-product of haze removal.},

Opt. Soc. Am. A21, 1841 (2004)]. Written in Numerical Python with calls to a robust constrained conjugate gradient method, AIDA has significantly improved run times over the original MISTRAL implementation. Included in AIDA is a scheme to automatically balance maximum-likelihood estimation and object regularization, which significantly decreases the amount of time and effort needed to generate satisfactory reconstructions. We validated AIDA using synthetic data spanning a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios and image types and demonstrated the algorithm to be effective for experimental data from adaptive optics-equipped telescope systems and wide-field microscopy.},

abstract = {We propose a three-dimensional (3D) imaging technique that can sense a 3D scene and computationally reconstruct it as a 3D volumetric image. Sensing of the 3D scene is carried out by obtaining elemental images optically using a pickup microlens array and a detector array. Reconstruction of volume pixels of the scene is accomplished by computationally simulating optical reconstruction according to ray optics. The entire pixels of the recorded elemental images contribute to volumetric reconstruction of the 3D scene. Image display planes at arbitrary distances from the display microlens array are computed and reconstructed by back propagating the elemental images through a computer synthesized pinhole array based on ray optics. We present experimental results of 3D image sensing and volume pixel reconstruction to test and verify the performance of the algorithm and the imaging system. The volume pixel values can be used for 3D image surface reconstruction.},

abstract = {The majority of computer vision applications assumes that the camera adheres to the pinhole camera model. However, most optical systems will introduce undesirable effects. By far, the most evident of these effects is radial lensing, which is particularly noticeable in fish-eye camera systems, where the effect is relatively extreme. Several authors have developed models of fish-eye lenses that can be used to describe the fish-eye displacement. Our aim is to evaluate the accuracy of several of these models. Thus, we present a method by which the lens curve of a fish-eye camera can be extracted using well-founded assumptions and perspective methods. Several of the models from the literature are examined against this empirically derived curve.},

The FBTS algorithm is utilized for a numerical-based study of a 3-D breast model based on an MRI. Several illumination schemes, based on different microwave transmitter/receiver configurations, are compared based on the quality of the reconstructed images of the breast model. A combination of cylindrical and planar arrays is shown to provide accurate estimates of the model electrical parameters that delineate the various regions of the breast. Although further analysis with this combination array demonstrates that tumors of reduced size and reduced contrast with the surrounding fibroglandular region are much more difficult (and in some cases not possible) to reconstruct, the study presents some promising initial results of a reconstruction technique for breast imaging and cancer detection.},

abstract = {In the last few years, several new algorithms based on graph cuts have been developed to solve energy minimization problems in computer vision. Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available.},

@article{Ng1948,
abstract = {By inserting a microlens array into the optical train of a conventional microscope, one can capture light fields of biological specimens in a single photograph. Although diffraction places a limit on the product of spatial and angular resolution in these light fields, we can nevertheless produce useful perspective views and focal stacks from them. Since microscopes are inherently orthographic devices, perspective views represent a new way to look at microscopic specimens. The ability to create focal stacks from a single photograph allows moving or light-sensitive specimens to be recorded. Applying 3D deconvolution to these focal stacks, we can produce a set of cross sections, which can be visualized using volume rendering. In this paper, we demonstrate a prototype light field microscope (LFM), analyze its optical performance, and show perspective views, focal stacks, and reconstructed volumes for a variety of biological specimens. We also show that synthetic focusing followed by 3D deconvolution is equivalent to applying limited-angle tomography directly to the 4D light field.

Descriptions of two different types of sky-imaging systems developed by the authors are presented, one of which has been developed into a commercially available instrument. Retrievals of fractional sky cover from automated processing methods are compared to human retrievals, both from direct observations and visual analyses of sky images. Although some uncertainty exists in fractional sky cover retrievals from sky images, this uncertainty is no greater than that attached to human observations for the commercially available sky-imager retrievals. Thus, the application of automatic digital image processing techniques on sky images is a useful method to complement, or even replace, traditional human observations of sky cover and, potentially, cloud type. Additionally, the possibilities for inferring other cloud},

abstract = {We present and discuss here the results of our work using MODIS (moderate
resolution imaging spectroradiometer) and MERIS (medium resolution
imaging spectrometer) satellite data to estimate the concentration
of chlorophyll- a (chl- a ) in reservoirs of the Dnieper River and
the Sea of Azov, which are typical case II waters, i.e., turbid and
productive. Our objective was to test the potential of satellite
remote sensing as a tool for near-real-time monitoring of chl- a
distribution in these water bodies. We tested the performance of
a recently developed three-band model, and its special case, a two-band
model, which use the reflectance at red and near-infrared wavelengths
for the retrieval of chl- a concentration. The higher spatial resolution
and the availability of a spectral band at around 708 nm with the
MERIS data offered great promise for these models. We compared results
from several different atmospheric correction procedures available
for MODIS and MERIS data. No one particular procedure was consistently
and systematically better than the rest. Nevertheless, even in the
absence of a perfect atmospheric correction procedure, both the three-band
and the two-band models showed promising results when compared with
in situ chl- a measurements. The challenges and limitations involved
in satellite remote monitoring of the chl- a distribution in turbid
productive waters are discussed.},

@article{Namer2009,
abstract = {Outdoor imaging in haze is plagued by poor visibility. A major problem is spatially-varying reduction of contrast by airlight, which is scattered by the haze particles towards the camera. However, images can be compensated for haze, and even yield a depth map of the scene. A key step in such scene recovery is subtraction of the airlight. In particular, this can be achieved by analyzing polarization-filtered images. This analysis requires parameters of the airlight, particularly its degree of polarization (DOP). These parameters were estimated in past studies by measuring pixels in sky areas. However, the sky is often unseen in the field of view. This paper derives several methods for estimating these parameters, when the sky is not in view. The methods are based on minor prior knowledge about a couple of scene points. Moreover, we propose blind estimation of the DOP, based on the image data. This estimation is based on independent component analysis (ICA). The methods were demonstrated in field experiments.},

abstract = {A new method is presented for retrieval of the aerosol and cloud optical depth using a CCD camera equipped with a fish-eye lens (all-sky imager system). In a first step, the proposed method retrieves the spectral radiance from sky images acquired by the all-sky imager system using a linear pseudoinverse algorithm. Then, the aerosol or cloud optical depth at 500 nm is obtained as that which minimizes the residuals between the zenith spectral radiance retrieved from the sky images and that estimated by the radiative transfer code. The method is tested under extreme situations including the presence of nonspherical aerosol particles. The comparison of optical depths derived from the all-sky imager with those retrieved with a sunphotometer operated side by side shows differences similar to the nominal error claimed in the aerosol optical depth retrievals from sunphotometer networks.},

abstract = {Visible-band and near infrared polarization and radiance images measured with a ground-based full-sky polarimeter are compared against a successive orders of scattering (SOS) radiative transfer model for 2009 summer cloud-free days in Bozeman, Montana, USA. The polarimeter measures radiance and polarization in 10-nm bands centered at 450 nm, 490 nm, 530 nm, 630 nm, and 700 nm. AERONET products are used to represent aerosols in the SOS model, while MISR satellite BRF products are used for the surface reflectance. While model results generally agree well with observation, the simulated degree of polarization is typically higher than observed data. Potential sources of this difference may include cloud contamination and/or underestimation of the AERONET-retrieved aerosol real refractive index. Problems with the retrieved parameters are not unexpected given the low aerosol optical depth range (0.025 to 0.17 at 500 nm) during the study and the corresponding difficulties that these conditions pose to the AERONET inversion algorithm.},

abstract = {Clouds reduce the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) of skylight relative to that of a clear sky. Even thin subvisual clouds in the "twilight zone" between clouds and aerosols produce a drop in skylight DOLP long before clouds become visible in the sky. In contrast, the angle of polarization (AOP) of light scattered by a cloud in a partly cloudy sky remains the same as in the clear sky for most cases. In unique instances, though, select clouds display AOP signatures that are oriented 90 degrees from the clear-sky AOP. For these clouds, scattered light oriented parallel to the scattering plane dominates the perpendicularly polarized Rayleigh-scattered light between the instrument and the cloud. For liquid clouds, this effect may assist cloud particle size identification because it occurs only over a relatively limited range of particle radii that will scatter parallel polarized light. Images are shown from a digital all-sky-polarization imager to illustrate these effects. Images are also shown that provide validation of previously published theories for weak (approximately 2\%) polarization parallel to the scattering plane for a 22 degrees halo.},

abstract = {When imaging in scattering media, visibility degrades as objects become more distant. Visibility can be significantly restored by computer vision methods that account for physical processes occurring during image formation. Nevertheless, such recovery is prone to noise amplification in pixels corresponding to distant objects, where the medium transmittance is low. We present an adaptive filtering approach that counters the above problems: while significantly improving visibility relative to raw images, it inhibits noise amplification. Essentially, the recovery formulation is regularized, where the regularization adapts to the spatially varying medium transmittance. Thus, this regularization does not blur close objects. We demonstrate the approach in atmospheric and underwater experiments, based on an automatic method for determining the medium transmittance.},

abstract = {We present an approach for easily removing the effects of haze from
passively acquired images. Our approach is based on the fact that
usually the natural illuminating light scattered by atmospheric particles
(airlight) is partially polarized. Optical filtering alone cannot
remove the haze effects, except in restricted situations. Our method,
however, stems from physics-based analysis that works under a wide
range of atmospheric and viewing conditions, even if the polarization
is low. The approach does not rely on specific scattering models
such as Rayleigh scattering and does not rely on the knowledge of
illumination directions. It can be used with as few as two images
taken through a polarizer at different orientations. As a byproduct,
the method yields a range map of the scene, which enables scene rendering
as if imaged from different viewpoints. It also yields information
about the atmospheric particles. We present experimental results
of complete dehazing of outdoor scenes, in far-from-ideal conditions
for polarization filtering. We obtain a great improvement of scene
contrast and correction of color.},

abstract = {Ground-based digital imager systems in the visible and near infrared region of the solar spectrum have the potential to nicely complement existing instruments and observation networks of National Weather Services with very accurate, high spatial and temporal resolution, 2D and 3D macroscopic cloud data such as cloud amount, cloud-base height and 3D cloud-base motion. This paper discusses two current approaches to ground-based cloud sensing: the prototype instrument used at ETH/MeteoSwiss within Cloudmap and Cloudmap2 for stereoscopy tests, and a Daylight Visible/NIR Whole Sky Imager (WSI) system developed and fielded by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The article includes descriptions of the radiometric and geometric calibration methods. Cloud amount, cloud-base height and cloud-base motion results from two ETH/MeteoSwiss measurement campaigns and from the operational WSI use at the German Weather Service (DWD) are shown. Finally, a case study with coincident satellite and ground data illustrates that ground-based digital imager systems are an interesting technique to validate satellite-based cloud-top heights and cloud-top motion winds of vertically thin clouds.},

abstract = {We are interested in analyzing and rendering the visual effects due to scattering of light by participating media such as fog, mist and haze. While a number of sophisticated approaches based on Monte Carlo and finite element simulation have been developed, these approaches are computationally very expensive. In the context of rendering, the most common real-time methods are essentially simple variants of the OpenGL fog model. While easy to use and specify, the OpenGL fog model excludes many important qualitative effects like glows around light sources, the effect of volumetric scattering on the appearance of surfaces such as the diffusing of glossy highlights and the appearance of objects under complex lighting such as environment maps. In this project, we have developed a new physically based model for single scattering that captures these effects while maintaining the real-time performance and the ease-of-use of the OpenGL fog model. Our model is based on an explicit analytic integration of the single scattering light transport equations for an isotropic point light source in a homogeneous participating medium. We have implemented the model in modern programmable graphics hardware using a few small numerical lookup tables stored as texture maps. Our model can also be easily adapted to generate the appearances of materials with arbitrary BRDFs, environment map lighting and pre-computed radiance transfer methods, in the presence of participating media.},

@inproceedings{tan,
abstract = {Bad weather, such as fog and haze, can significantly degrade the visibility of a scene. Optically, this is due to the substantial presence of particles in the atmosphere that absorb and scatter light. In computer vision, the absorption and scattering processes are commonly modeled by a linear combination of the direct attenuation and the airlight. Based on this model, a few methods have been proposed, and most of them require multiple input images of a scene, which have either different degrees of polarization or different atmospheric conditions. This requirement is the main drawback of these methods, since in many situations, it is difficult to be fulfilled. To resolve the problem, we introduce an automated method that only requires a single input image. This method is based on two basic observations: first, images with enhanced visibility (or clear-day images) have more contrast than images plagued by bad weather; second, airlight whose variation mainly depends on the distance of objects to the viewer, tends to be smooth. Relying on these two observations, we develop a cost function in the framework of Markov random fields, which can be efficiently optimized by various techniques, such as graph-cuts or belief propagation. The method does not require the geometrical information of the input image, and is applicable for both color and gray images.},

We simulate the imaging process from data acquisition to reconstruction using a battery of test images. We evaluate the reconstructions generated by each geometry for locating chemical leaks, identifying plumes, and evaluating human chemical exposures. This approach uses three numerical image-quality measures for both static and time-varying concentration maps. Visual evaluation is the most useful method of evaluating the geometries. The numerical measures are not always consistent with one another or with the visual evaluation. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using geometries with only a few detectors for tomographic imaging of air pollutants.},

abstract = {Five limited-data computed tomography algorithms are compared. The algorithms used are adapted versions of the algebraic reconstruction technique, the multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique, the Gerchberg--Papoulis algorithm, a spectral extrapolation algorithm descended from that of Harris $\backslash$[J. Opt. Soc. Am. 54, 931-936 (1964)$\backslash$], and an algorithm based on the singular value decomposition technique. These algorithms were used to reconstruct phantom data with realistic levels of noise from a number of different imaging geometries. The phantoms, the imaging geometries, and the noise were chosen to simulate the conditions encountered in typical computed tomography applications in the physical sciences, and the implementations of the algorithms were optimized for these applications. The multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique algorithm gave the best results overall; the algebraic reconstruction technique gave the best results for very smooth objects or very noisy (20-dB signal-to-noise ratio) data. My implementations of both of these algorithms incorporate apriori knowledge of the sign of the object, its extent, and its smoothness. The smoothness of the reconstruction is enforced through the use of an appropriate object model (by use of cubic B-spline basis functions and a number of object coefficients appropriate to the object being reconstructed). The average reconstruction error was 1.7\% of the maximum phantom value with the multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique of a phantom with moderate-to-steep gradients by use of data from five viewing angles with a 30-dB signal-to-noise ratio.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional cross sections of the sulphur dioxide (SO2) distribution
in the volcanic gas plume of Mt. Etna were reconstructed using tomographic
techniques. The data for these projections were generated by a network
of five automated scanning spectrometers, positioned on the flanks
of the volcano. These measure slant-column amounts of SO2 at 105
different angles, every four minutes. Stable wind conditions allow
the plume to be monitored on 82\% of days. A time-series of plume
cross sections was computed, revealing the potential of this method
to track variations in plume position and structure on timescales
of minutes to hours, a result of potential importance for air traffic
and civil defence in case of eruption, when copious amounts of fine
ash can be transported.},

@article{Zacharopoulos2009,
abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) aims at recovering three-dimensional images of absorption and scattering parameters inside diffusive body based on small number of transmission measurements at the boundary of the body. This image reconstruction problem is known to be an ill-posed inverse problem, which requires use of prior information for successful reconstruction. We present a shape based method for DOT, where we assume a priori that the unknown body consist of disjoint subdomains with different optical properties. We utilize spherical harmonics expansion to parameterize the reconstruction problem with respect to the subdomain boundaries, and introduce a finite element (FEM) based algorithm that uses a novel 3D mesh subdivision technique to describe the mapping from spherical harmonics coefficients to the 3D absorption and scattering distributions inside a unstructured volumetric FEM mesh. We evaluate the shape based method by reconstructing experimental DOT data, from a cylindrical phantom with one inclusion with high absorption and one with high scattering. The reconstruction was monitored, and we found a 87\% reduction in the Hausdorff measure between targets and reconstructed inclusions, 96\% success in recovering the location of the centers of the inclusions and 87\% success in average in the recovery for the volumes.},
